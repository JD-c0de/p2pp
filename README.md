### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Architecture Compatibility
- **Never use Universal2 builds** - they cause crashes with PyQt5
- Download the correct build for your system architecture
- See [Architecture Build Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE_BUILDS.md) for detailed instructions

## Getting Started

Have a look at the [P2PP Wiki pages](https://github.com/tomvandeneede/p2pp/wiki/Home) to get you started.

## For Developers

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository

cd p2pp

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies for your platform
pip install -r requirements-mac.txt     # macOS
pip install -r requirements-win.txt     # Windows
pip install -r requirements-linux.txt   # Linux
```

### Building Locally
```bash
# macOS - Intel
export ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64"
python setup.py py2app --arch=x86_64

# macOS - Apple Silicon
export ARCHFLAGS="-arch arm64"
python setup.py py2app --arch=arm64

# Windows
python setup.py bdist_msi

# Linux
python setup.py bdist_rpm
```

### Testing Builds
```bash
# Test your build works correctly
python scripts/test_architecture_builds.py
```

## Architecture & Build System

P2PP uses architecture-specific builds to ensure maximum compatibility and performance:

- **Separate Intel/ARM builds** prevent QtWebEngine compatibility issues
- **End-to-end testing** validates each build on target platforms  
- **Cross-compilation support** allows ARM Macs to build Intel binaries
- **Automated CI/CD** builds and tests all architectures on every release

See [Architecture Build Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE_BUILDS.md) for complete details.
