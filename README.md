# P2PP - **Palette2 Post Processing tool for PrusaSlicer/Slic3r PE**

P2PP is a post-processing tool that optimizes G-code files for Palette 2 multi-material printing, ensuring better print quality and reliability.

## Download & Installation

### Quick Architecture Check
Not sure which build to download? Run this script to find out:
```bash
# If you have Python/uv installed:
uv run check-arch

# Or download and run:
python scripts/check_architecture.py
```

### Available Builds

#### macOS
- **P2PP-intel.dmg** - For Intel-based Macs (x86_64)
- **P2PP-arm.dmg** - For Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3)

#### Windows
- **P2PP.msi** - Universal Windows installer

### Important: Architecture-Specific Builds

P2PP provides **separate builds for different architectures** to ensure maximum compatibility. Universal2 builds are **not supported** due to PyQt5/QtWebEngine limitations.

If you download the wrong architecture, you may see errors like:
```
ImportError: dlopen(...QtWebEngineWidgets.abi3.so, 0x0002): 
tried: '...' (mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture 
(have (arm64), need (x86_64)))
```

üìñ **[Architecture Build Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE_BUILDS.md)**

## Development

P2PP uses modern Python tooling with **uv** for fast package management and testing.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Set up development environment
uv sync --dev
uv run dev-setup

# Run tests
uv run test

# Check your architecture
uv run check-arch
```

### Common Development Commands

```bash
# Testing
uv run test              # Run all tests
uv run test-unit         # Fast unit tests
uv run test-integration  # Integration tests
uv run test-e2e          # End-to-end tests
uv run test-coverage     # With coverage report

# Code Quality
uv run format           # Format code
uv run lint             # Run linting

# Building
uv run build-macos-intel  # Intel macOS
uv run build-macos-arm    # ARM macOS
uv run build-windows      # Windows MSI
uv run build-linux-rpm    # Linux RPM
```

## Features

- **Multi-material optimization** for Palette 2 printers
- **Architecture-aware builds** for maximum compatibility
- **Comprehensive testing** with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Cross-platform support** for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Modern development workflow** with uv and pytest

## Why uv?

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for several advantages:

- **‚ö° Fast**: Incredibly fast dependency resolution and installation
- **üîß Cross-platform**: Works identically on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **üêç Python-native**: No need to learn Make or other build tools
- **üì¶ Dependency management**: Handles virtual environments automatically
- **üöÄ Modern**: Uses modern Python packaging standards
